# SDDC_FX3 Test Tools

Host-side test tools for validating the SDDC_FX3 firmware on RX888mk2
hardware.

## Prerequisites

```
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev
git submodule update --init       # pulls rx888_tools for firmware upload
```

## Building

```
cd tests
make            # builds fx3_cmd and rx888_stream
make fx3_cmd    # builds just the vendor command exerciser
make clean      # removes build artifacts
```

## fx3_cmd -- Vendor Command Exerciser

Sends individual USB vendor requests to an RX888mk2 and reports
PASS/FAIL.  The device must already have firmware loaded (PID 0x00F1).

### Basic commands

```
./fx3_cmd test                          # probe device info
./fx3_cmd gpio 0x800                    # set GPIO word (LED_BLUE on)
./fx3_cmd adc 64000000                  # set ADC clock to 64 MHz
./fx3_cmd att 15                        # set attenuator (0-63)
./fx3_cmd vga 128                       # set VGA gain (0-255)
./fx3_cmd start                         # start GPIF streaming
./fx3_cmd stop                          # stop GPIF streaming
./fx3_cmd i2cr 0xC0 0 1                 # I2C read (Si5351 status)
./fx3_cmd i2cw 0xC0 3 0xFF              # I2C write
./fx3_cmd raw 0xCC                      # send arbitrary vendor request
./fx3_cmd stats                         # read GETSTATS counters
./fx3_cmd reset                         # reboot FX3 to bootloader
```

./fx3_cmd double_start                  # back-to-back STARTFX3
./fx3_cmd i2c_under_load                # I2C read while streaming
./fx3_cmd sustained_stream              # 30s continuous streaming check
./fx3_cmd abandoned_stream              # simulate host crash (no STOPFX3)
```

### Consumer-failure tests

The `abandoned_stream` test (and future variants) exercises the most
common real-world failure mode: **the host application dies without
sending STOPFX3**.

When an SDR application crashes, is `kill -9`'d, or loses USB
connectivity mid-stream, the FX3 is left streaming into the void.  DMA
buffers fill, the GPIF stalls, and the watchdog fires.  But recovery is
futile — there is no consumer, so the freshly-recovered DMA channel
stalls again within milliseconds.  Without a recovery cap, the firmware
loops forever: detect stall → recover → stall → recover → …

This is not an edge case.  SDR applications are complex, host-side
software, and unclean exits are routine:

- User hits Ctrl-C on a streaming application
- Application segfaults during DSP processing
- USB hub glitch drops the device momentarily
- System suspend/resume while streaming
- OOM killer takes the application

The `abandoned_stream` test simulates this directly:

1. Starts ADC + GPIF streaming at 64 MHz
2. **Does not read EP1.  Does not send STOPFX3.**
3. Waits 10 seconds, taking GETSTATS snapshots at t=0, t=5s, t=10s
4. Checks whether `streaming_faults` plateaued (recovery capped) or is
   still climbing (unbounded loop)
5. Sends STOPFX3 to clean up, verifies EP0 still responds

**Before `WDG_MAX_RECOV` fix**: FAIL — faults grow at ~1/sec in both
windows.
**After fix**: PASS — faults plateau once the cap is reached.

The soak harness assigns this scenario a high weight (15) — tied for
second-highest — reflecting the likelihood of consumer-side failures in
the field.

Future consumer-failure variants to consider:

- **Partial-read abandon**: read some EP1 data, then stop reading (simulates
  application hang rather than crash)
- **Rapid reconnect**: abandon stream, close/reopen USB handle, restart
  (simulates application restart without device reset)
- **Suspend/resume**: abandon stream, issue USB reset, verify clean restart

All follow the same pattern: start streaming → simulate failure → observe
via GETSTATS → clean up → verify EP0 alive.

### Interactive debug console

```
./fx3_cmd debug
```

Opens a live debug console over USB:

- Enables debug mode via `TESTFX3 wValue=1`
- Puts stdin in raw mode (character-at-a-time, no echo)
- Polls `READINFODEBUG` every 50 ms for firmware output
- Typed characters are sent to the firmware; Enter sends CR
- Ctrl-C to quit

#### Local command escape (`!`)

Type `!` to switch to local command mode.  This lets you run any
`fx3_cmd` subcommand without leaving the debug session:

```
!adc 64000000        → runs fx3_cmd adc 64000000
!start               → runs fx3_cmd start
!stop_gpif_state     → runs the GPIF state test
!help                → lists all available local commands
```

Debug output polling continues between commands.  Some test commands
take several seconds; output is paused during execution.

### Soak test (multi-hour stress)

```
./fx3_cmd soak [hours] [seed]
```

Randomly cycles through all test scenarios (weighted by severity) for
the given duration, running a health check between each cycle.
Deterministic given a seed for reproducibility.  Ctrl-C triggers early
shutdown with a full summary.

```
# Quick 1-minute sanity check
./fx3_cmd soak 0.016 42

# Default: 1 hour, random seed
./fx3_cmd soak

# 8-hour overnight run
./fx3_cmd soak 8
```

Output includes a status line every 10 cycles and a final table:

```
=== SOAK TEST SUMMARY ===
Duration: 01:00:00  Seed: 12345  Cycles: 1847

Scenario              Runs  Pass  Fail
stop_start_cycle       370   370     0
wedge_recovery         277   275     2
...
TOTAL                 1847  1843     4
```

## soak_test.sh -- Soak Test Wrapper

### Requirements

- RX888mk2 connected via USB
- `fx3_cmd` and `rx888_stream` built (run `make` first)

### Example output

```
